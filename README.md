## Project Overview

For this project, you will use regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions about what the data means.

It is up to you to decide what data from this dataset to use and how to use it. 

### Business Problem

It is up to you to define a stakeholder and business problem appropriate to this dataset.

If you are struggling to define a stakeholder, we recommend you complete a project for a real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and/or sell homes. A business problem you could focus on for this stakeholder is the need to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.
