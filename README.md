## Project Overview

Every year homes are bought and sold in the Washington state area. Seattle, one of the largest cities in Washington state, belongs to a county named King County. The buying and selling of houses occurs every year in King County in the state of Washington. The housing price values are recorded and may vary across many thousands and millions of dollars. The worth of a house may depend on many different factors including square footage of a home, number of bathrooms and/or bedrooms, and number of floors. Regression modeling is implemented to analyze house sales in King County and decide how to sell a home with the greatest net worth possible.

## Business Problem

In this housing project, I am acting with a real estate agency in the King County area of Washington state. The real estate agency wants to help homeowners determine the best ways to improve their homes and to enhance the estimated value of their homes in preparation for putting them on the market to be sold. I plan to help homeowners come up with the best ideas for home renovations to increase the worth of their homes and allow homeowners to sell their homes for the highest monetary value possible.

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. The dataset covers house sale prices between May 2014 and May 2015 in King County of Washington state.

I decide what data from this dataset to use and how to use it. 

## Data Preparation

Factors that influence how well a house might sell in King County include square footage of a home, number of bathrooms and/or bedrooms, and number of floors in a home. I created graphs of the relationships between these attributes and the sale prices of the homes in King County they related to in order to connect how home sale price and the various attributes affect one another. The graphs are shown below:
